Customer contact has been excellent and we have received great feedback which has strengthened our companies reputation. Jakub has been keen on learning new things, and has always taken on tasks even though they may be difficult and complicated. If mistakes are made, Jakub has always taken it upon himself to correct them even if it is to his own cost. As Jakub leaves us now we wish him all the best with his new Job wherever it may be.'",
