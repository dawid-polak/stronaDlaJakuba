I took part in the construction of booths at big events. I also did electrical work that includes renovating the electrical part of old, delicate and exclusive historical buildings, apartments and offices. At times my work included administrative work, such as taking care of the company's economy, accountant tasks, organising and keeping track of storage content. Because of my very varied range of tasks I acquired traits, such as flexibility. While working for Burtec I got hired in by companies, such as Mysec, Adapt and DAEL.",
